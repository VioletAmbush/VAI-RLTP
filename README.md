## VAI: Rogue-Lite Tarkov Project

This mod is a Rogue-Lite conversion of the progression system.

Changes:


1. Death

After death - your stash is wiped. But there are some items that you will get to keep:
1. Money: RUB, USD, EUR, BTC and GP;
2. Items inside equipped secure container;
3. Unsecure containers in stash and items inside them;
4. Armor and Weapon repair kits.


2. Money

Money is finally scarce:
1. No selling (Do ya really expect to sell stuff when you go to the store?);
2. No money for most default quests;
3. Flea is disabled.

But there are also new ways of making money.


3. Hideout

Hideout stations now provide different items on death or survival.
- Workbench, generator - barter items for weapons;
- Lavatory, rest space - barter items for gear;
- Shooting range - barter items for grenades;
- Security, vents and illumination - money on survival.
And so on.


4. Gear

You start at the very bottom of the food chain.
No looting weapons from bodies.
Progressing through quests will unlock new weapons/gear.

Most gear have to be bartered. The premise is simple:
- Fabrics - Armors, rigs, backpacks;
- Blue tape, duct tape - Pistols;
- Wires, Cables - SMGs;
- Lamps - Shotguns;
- Gunpowders - Assault rifles;
- Chainlets, gold chains  - DMRs;
- Cigarettes - Sniper rifles.
And so on.


5. Profiles

There are 15 new profile presets (plus gungame, plus custom) to choose from.
You must create new profile with one of the new presets for this mod to work properly.


While this mod should be playable on its own, it was designed and balanced to be played with our other mod: VAI-NRTP
**Most of changes are configurable in config files.**


Known issues:
- After selecting face/voice traders might have an empty assortment - just restart the client and it should fix itself.
